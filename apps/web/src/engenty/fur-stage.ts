/**
 * One WebGL2 context per coat for every large engenty on the page.
 *
 * Browsers cap live WebGL contexts per document (~16 in Chrome, fewer in
 * Safari) and silently evict the oldest once you pass it — so a page that gives
 * each engenty its own context breaks as soon as there are a few of them, which
 * a styleguide grid reaches immediately. Instead a single offscreen context
 * renders each engenty in turn and blits the result into that instance's plain
 * 2D canvas.
 *
 * The offscreen buffer only ever grows, so a mixed page settles on one
 * allocation sized to its largest engenty and stops reallocating.
